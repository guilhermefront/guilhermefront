## Hi there 👋 

#### I'm a Front end developer which:

- 🎮 consistently create and maintain types for DefinetelyTyped "@types" repo
- 🦾 works with great ease on the most complex tasks involving react, typescript, nextjs, scss, styled-components...
- 📖 love to read docs
- 💻 is passionate about building quality web apps 


I feel like developing stuff isn't a job for me (just the bunch of meetings I have to be involved to 😝), so studying and coding are actually fun tasks for me that I dedicate several hours a day to get better and better.

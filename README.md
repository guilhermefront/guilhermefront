## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer that:

- ðŸ¦¾ works with great ease on the most complex tasks involving react, typescript, nextjs, nodejs...
- ðŸ“– loves to absorb knowledge and apply deliberate practice to constantly keep getting better
- ðŸ’» is passionate about building great solutions 
- ðŸŽ® likes to share experiences and knowledge to potentially improve other people's lives.


I'm privileged to work doing what I like, which is why I'll always apply a tremendous effort to do better every single day. 

When I'm not coding, you'll probably see me in the library or the mma gym :)
